## Introduction
Connecting data through Azure OpenAI Service within Microsoft Copilot Studio enables your Copilots to utilize Azure resources effectively via the Generative Answers node. Leveraging the robust capabilities of Azure AI Search and Azure OpenAI, these copilots can deliver responses that are both contextually relevant and compliant with your organization's guidelines.
In this blog we will see how to create a Power Apps FAQ copilot utilizing the official Microsoft PowerApps documentation PDF and leveraging the Azure AI Search and Azure Open AI.

### Process Flow Explanation

The overall process flow that we will see in this explanation is as follows : 

1. **User Interaction**: A user initiates a query related to Power Apps via the Copilot interface.
2. **Copilot Processing**: The Copilot captures the user's query and passes it as a prompt to the Azure OpenAI, which is configured as a datasource.
3. **Azure OpenAI Processing**: Azure OpenAI processes the query using its generative capabilities, accessing the indexed Power Apps documentation stored in Azure AI Search.
4. **Azure AI Search Integration**: Azure AI Search retrieves relevant information from the uploaded Power Apps documentation PDF, stored in a storage account.
5. **Contextual Response**: The Azure OpenAI generates a contextual response based on the retrieved information and sends it back to the Copilot.
6. **User Display**: The Copilot displays the contextual response to the user, providing accurate and detailed answers to their Power Apps-related queries.

This integration allows users to get precise answers to their queries by leveraging the power of Azure's AI services, making it a valuable tool for enhancing productivity and knowledge access.

## Prerequisites
Before diving into the implementation, ensure you have the following:
- An active Azure subscription.
- Access to Microsoft Copilot Studio.
- Power Apps Documentation PDF.

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Download the Power Apps Documentation
Head over to the Power Apps Documentation and download the PDF. We will index it using the Azure search service and use it to generate contextual answers to user queries around Power Apps.

2. Select **Continue in Copilot Studio**, which will take us to Copilot Studio to continue with the copilot creation.
   ![Continue in Copilot Studio](\images\11_CopilotOpenAI\32.png)
3. Specify the copilot name and click on **Create**.
   ![Specify Copilot Name](\images\11_CopilotOpenAI\33.png)
4. This initializes the copilot, which is already connected to the Azure OpenAI Instance.
   ![Copilot Initialized](\images\11_CopilotOpenAI\34.png)
5. Head over to topics and select the **Conversational boosting system** topic.
   ![Select Conversational Boosting System](\images\11_CopilotOpenAI\35.png)
6. It contains a **Generative answers node** preconfigured with the Azure OpenAI instance set up earlier.
   ![Generative Answers Node](\images\11_CopilotOpenAI\36.png)
7. Click on the connection properties. Under the **General** tab, you can see the model details and parameters used for generating answers.
   ![General Tab](\images\11_CopilotOpenAI\37.png)
8. In the **Model data** tab, you can see the Azure AI Search data source and the field from which the data is grounded.
   ![Model Data Tab](\images\11_CopilotOpenAI\38.png)
9. The copilot is auto-configured and connected to the Azure OpenAI instance, which is internally connected with the Azure AI Search Instance.

### Step 6: Publish the Bot
1. We can publish the bot to different channels. For now, deploy it to Teams.
   ![Deploy to Teams](\images\11_CopilotOpenAI\40.png)
2. Head over to **Channels -> Microsoft Teams -> Turn on Teams**.
   ![Turn on Teams](\images\11_CopilotOpenAI\41.png)
3. Click on **Availability Options** to choose how to distribute the app in Teams.
   ![Availability Options](\images\11_CopilotOpenAI\42.png)
4. You can either deploy it to the app store through admin approval or upload the app as a zip and use it as a personal app.
   ![Deploy Options](\images\11_CopilotOpenAI\43.png)
5. The app becomes available in the Teams admin centre, and the admin can now publish it for org-wide use.
   ![App in Teams Admin Centre](\images\11_CopilotOpenAI\44.png)
6. Access the app from the Teams App Store and start a conversation. Ask anything about Power Apps, and the copilot will fetch contextual answers from the grounded Power Apps Documentation PDF and provide responses.
   ![Access App in Teams](\images\11_CopilotOpenAI\45.png)

Thus we have completed the implementation and demo of a scalable Copilot that can leverage Azure AI search and Azure Open AI to provide us with contextual answers for our questions. 

### Alternate Approach : Power Apps Documentation as Local Datasource 

So far we explored how we can build a scalable Copilot that using Azure AI search Index as the primary data source. Now lets see how we can implement the same using the native local datasource approach in Copilot. FOr this we can upload the same Power Platform PDF documentation as a Local File Knowledge base : 
![Access App in Teams](\images\11_CopilotOpenAI\46.png)

Once uploaded, depending on the size, the processing time varies and once ready we can see the status in the Knowledge section 
![Access App in Teams](\images\11_CopilotOpenAI\47.png)

We can now create a new Topic and add the **Generative Answers** node and connect to this knowledge source that we have uploaded. 
![Access App in Teams](\images\11_CopilotOpenAI\48.png)

We can test the Copilot's ability to use the local knowledge source by initiating a conversation and asking questions and we can see that we are getting back the contextual response along with citations.

## Conclusion
Integrating Azure OpenAI Service with Microsoft Copilot Studio opens up a lot of possibilities for creating intelligent, data-driven copilots. This guide has walked you through the process of setting up Azure AI Search, configuring Azure OpenAI, and seamlessly connecting these services in Copilot Studio. By harnessing the power of Azure's AI capabilities, you can build copilots that provide rich, contextual responses tailored to your organizational needs. We also saw how the same Power Apps PDF documentation can be used as a Local Source Knowledge Data Source. Depending on the use case and complexity of search involved, we can use either of them as a source of generative answers.
