## Introduction

Enhancing user experience is key to boosting engagement and productivity. Adaptive Cards provide a versatile and dynamic way to present rich content in a structured format. When integrated with Copilot and Office 365 connectors, they can significantly enrich the user experience. This blog post explores how to leverage Adaptive Cards within Copilot to create a seamless and engaging **Rewards and Recognition Program**  for your organization.

## Understanding Adaptive Cards

Adaptive Cards are a platform-agnostic way to present and interact with information in a consistent and visually appealing manner. They are JSON-based and can be rendered natively in a host application like Microsoft Teams, Outlook, or any other application that supports Adaptive Cards. We can leverage adaptive cards in Copilots as well to enable richer conversations with a better user experience. The detailed schema explorer that documents the usage of various adaptive card elements is present [here](https://adaptivecards.io/explorer/). We can also give a try at building the adaptive cards using the online designer available [here](https://adaptivecards.io/designer/).

## Use Case: Reward and Recognition Program

Let’s delve into a practical scenario: implementing a Reward and Recognition Program where employees can select and order a reward based on their eligibility. We’ll explore how to integrate Adaptive Cards with Copilot and utilize Office 365 and Dataverse actions to build an end-to-end bot without the use of Power Automate.

**Overview of the Process**

Lets take a look at the overall process that we are implementing with Copilot and Connector Actions
- **Use the Office 365 mail connector** to get the current user's email ID.
- **Query the Dataverse table** using connector action to check if the user has already claimed a reward.
- If the user has not claimed a reward, **provide an Adaptive Card** for selecting a product and entering the shipping address.
- **Send the user's selection and address via email** using the Office 365 mail connector actionto the concerned team to process the order.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Building the Rewards and Recognition Copilot

### Step 1: Setting Up Your Environment

Before you start creating the copilot, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
- Microsoft Copilot Studio access.
- Dataverse environment with your enterprise data.

### Step 2: Preparing Your Data in Dataverse

Ensure your Dataverse instance contains all necessary information regarding who has already claimed the reward. We have created the table “Rewards” with the below columns. The table contains a record for each employee and the “Reward Claimed?” field will be used to keep track of whether he/she has claimed the reward.

![Step 2](\images\05_CopilotUsingAdaptiveCard\1.png)

### Step 3: Creating the Copilot in Copilot Studio

1. Head over to [Copilot Studio](https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com/) and click on **Create**.

    ![Step 3.1](\images\05_CopilotUsingAdaptiveCard\1_1.png)

2. Select **New copilot** to create a blank copilot from scratch.

    ![Step 3.2](\images\05_CopilotUsingAdaptiveCard\1_2.png)

3. Describe the copilot functionality and provide any specific instructions. Click on **Create** to provision the copilot.

    ![Step 3.3](\images\05_CopilotUsingAdaptiveCard\2.png)

### Step 4: Enable Generative Selection of Topics

1. Click on **Edit**, then edit the copilot details like name, icon, and description.
2. Click on **Settings** to enable the Generative selection of topics so that topics will be auto-selected based on user conversation.

    ![Step 4.1](\images\05_CopilotUsingAdaptiveCard\3.png)

3. To enable the automatic detection of topics from user interaction:
    - Click on **Generative AI**.
    - Select **Generative(preview)**.
    - Click on **Save** to update the settings.
    - Click on the **Close** icon to go back to the home page of this custom copilot.

    ![Step 4.2](\images\05_CopilotUsingAdaptiveCard\4.png)

### Step 5: Create Topics

1. Click on **Topics** from the navigation menu.

    ![Step 5.1](\images\05_CopilotUsingAdaptiveCard\5.png)

2. To add the topic, click on **Add a Topic** and select **Create from description with Copilot**.

    ![Step 5.2](\images\05_CopilotUsingAdaptiveCard\6.png)

3. Provide the topic description details and click on **Create**. 
    ![Step 5.3](\images\05_CopilotUsingAdaptiveCard\7.png)
	
4. This will provision the topic skeleton based on the provided description.

    ![Step 5.4](\images\05_CopilotUsingAdaptiveCard\8.png)

### Step 6: Adding the Office 365 Mail Connector

1. Click on the **+** sign to add a new node.
2. Select **Call an action**.
3. Search for **Office 365** in the search bar.
4. Select **Get my profile (V2)**.

    ![Step 6.1](\images\05_CopilotUsingAdaptiveCard\9.png)

5. The Office 365 mail connector is now added from the Connector tab, which will help fetch the current user’s email.

    ![Step 6.2](\images\05_CopilotUsingAdaptiveCard\18.png)

### Step 7: Querying Dataverse

Using the current user's email, lets try to check if the user has already claimed the reward by querying the dataverse table. 

1. Click on the **+** Sign to add a new conversation node.
2. Select **Call an action**.
3. Click on the **Connector** tab and search for Dataverse.
4. Select the action **List rows from selected environment**.

    ![Step 7.1](\images\05_CopilotUsingAdaptiveCard\19.png)

5. Configure the inputs by specifying the environment and the table name from which to pick the records.

    ![Step 7.2](\images\05_CopilotUsingAdaptiveCard\20.png)

6. Configure the **Advanced inputs** section to filter the rows and get only the necessary data:
    - Click on **Advanced inputs**.
    - Mention the **internal name** of the Dataverse table’s field.
    - Click on the **right arrow** to expand the filter columns field.
    - Specify the **OData filter query** to fetch the records that match the condition (email ID = current user’s email and Reward claimed field = "No").
    - Click on **Insert** to add the filter query to the action.

    ![Step 7.3](\images\05_CopilotUsingAdaptiveCard\21.png)

**Setting Variables**

1. Assign the output of the Dataverse action to a variable by clicking on **Create new**.

    ![Step 8.1](\images\05_CopilotUsingAdaptiveCard\22_5.png)

2. Get the number of rows returned from the Dataverse table into a variable by selecting **Set a variable value** from the variable management option.

    ![Step 8.2](\images\05_CopilotUsingAdaptiveCard\23.png)

3. In the **Set variable value** node, select **Create a new variable** and name it as `varRecordCount` .

    ![Step 8.3](\images\05_CopilotUsingAdaptiveCard\24.png)
	
4.  Use the `CountRows(Topic.varOutput)` expression in the **Formula** tab to get the table row count value into the variable `varRecordCount`.

    ![Step 8.4](\images\05_CopilotUsingAdaptiveCard\28.png)

### Step 8: Adding Conditions and Adaptive Cards

1. Add a condition to check if the current user is eligible for reward selection. If the record count is greater than 0, it means the reward was not claimed previously.

    ![Step 9.1](\images\05_CopilotUsingAdaptiveCard\29.png)

2. In the condition, check if `varRecordCount` is greater than 0. If so, add an adaptive card that gives the user the option to choose a reward. Otherwise, show a message that the reward has already been claimed.

    ![Step 9.2](\images\05_CopilotUsingAdaptiveCard\30.png)

3. Lets add the adaptive card JSON :

            {
              "type": "Input.ChoiceSet",
              "id": "productChoice",
              "label": "Select a product:",
              "choices": [
                {
                  "title": "Kindle",
                  "value": "Kindle"
                },

              "altText": "Address",
              "size": "Small"
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          "type": "Column",
          "width": "stretch",
          "items": [
            {
              "type": "Input.Text",
              "id": "address",
              "placeholder": "Enter your address",
              "label": "Address",
              "isMultiline": true
            }
          ],
          "verticalContentAlignment": "Center"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "actions": [
    {
      "type": "Action.Submit",
      "title": "Submit"
    }
  ]
}

```
Click on the adaptive card and paste the above JSON in the **Edit JSON** pane.

![Step 9.3](\images\05_CopilotUsingAdaptiveCard\31.png)

4. To use images in the adaptive card:
    - Create a **Storage Account**.
    - Within the Containers, create a **new container**.    

    ![Step 9.4](\images\05_CopilotUsingAdaptiveCard\32.png)
	
	- Upload the images and refer to the image URL in the adaptive card.

    ![Step 9.5](\images\05_CopilotUsingAdaptiveCard\33.png)

5. The adaptive card now asks the user to select the reward and shipment address, saved in the variables `productChoice` and `address`, respectively.

    ![Step 9.6](\images\05_CopilotUsingAdaptiveCard\34.png)

**Sending Confirmation and Follow-Up Actions**

1. Show a confirmation message back to the user as another adaptive card. Click on **Send a message**.

    ![Step 10.1](\images\05_CopilotUsingAdaptiveCard\35.png)

2. In the message node, click on **Add** and select **Adaptive Card**.

    ![Step 10.2](\images\05_CopilotUsingAdaptiveCard\36.png)

3. Configure the card by selecting it and clicking on **Formula**. Use the **Edit formula** option to add the confirmation message back to the user.

    ![Step 10.3](\images\05_CopilotUsingAdaptiveCard\37.png)
4. The formula schema used is : 

``` 
{
  '$schema': "http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json",
  type: "AdaptiveCard",
  version: "1.4",
  body: [
    {
      type: "TextBlock",
      text: "Thank You !",
      weight: "Bolder",
      size: "Large",
      wrap: true
    },
    {
      type: "ColumnSet",
      columns: [
        {
          type: "Column",
          width: "auto",
          items: [
            {
              type: "Image",
              url: "https://adaptivecardsbot.blob.core.windows.net/imagestore/approval.png",
              size: "Medium",
              altText: "Thank You Image"
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          type: "Column",
          width: "stretch",
          items: [
            {
              type: "TextBlock",
              text: "Your response has been recorded and we will ship the reward to the mentioned address at the earliest.",
              wrap: true
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  msteams: {
    width: "Full"
  }
}

```
Thus we have updated the Adaptive Card formula to show a confirmation message back to the user

![Step 10.3](\images\05_CopilotUsingAdaptiveCard\38.png)

5. As the final step , Send a mail to the concerned team with the user selections:
    - Select **Call an action** -> **Connector** -> **Send an email (V2)**.
	
![Step 10.3](\images\05_CopilotUsingAdaptiveCard\39.png)

6. We can configure the connector by :
    - Configure the Office 365 connector by mentioning the **To** and **Subject** fields.
    - Click on the right arrow of the **Body** to update the mail content.
    - Select the **Formula** tab.
    - Add the below formula: 
	  ```
	  Concatenate("The reward selected by ", Topic.displayName, " is ", Topic.productChoice, ". The delivery address is: ", Topic.address)
	  ```
    - Click on **Insert**.

![Step 10.4](\images\05_CopilotUsingAdaptiveCard\40.png)

### Step 9: Publishing to Teams

1. To complete the integration, deploy the copilot to Microsoft Teams after publishing it:
    - Select **Channels**.
    - Click on **Microsoft Teams**.
    - Select **Turn On Teams**.

    ![Step 11.1](\images\05_CopilotUsingAdaptiveCard\41.png)

2. The Teams channel is now added. Click on **Availability options**.

    ![Step 11.2](\images\05_CopilotUsingAdaptiveCard\42.png)

3. You can either make this available in the Teams app store for everyone to use or download the zip and upload the package to Teams as a custom app. For this example, select **Show to everyone in my org**. This will send the app for admin approval.

    ![Step 11.3](\images\05_CopilotUsingAdaptiveCard\43.png)

4. Head to the Teams admin center to approve and publish the app.

    ![Step 11.4](\images\05_CopilotUsingAdaptiveCard\44.png)

5. The app will now be available for organizational use.

    ![Step 11.5](\images\05_CopilotUsingAdaptiveCard\45.png)

### Step 10: Testing the Copilot

1. Test the copilot by initiating a conversation. The copilot checks Dataverse and finds that the user is claiming the reward for the first time, showing the adaptive card options to select the reward and shipment address.

    ![Step 12.1](\images\05_CopilotUsingAdaptiveCard\50.png)

2. Upon submission, the copilot provides a success confirmation message and sends the follow-up action mail to the concerned team to start the reward dispatch.

    ![Step 12.2](\images\05_CopilotUsingAdaptiveCard\51.png)
