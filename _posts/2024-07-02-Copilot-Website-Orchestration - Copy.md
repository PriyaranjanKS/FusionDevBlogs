In this guide, we will walk through the steps to create a Farming Assistant chatbot using Microsoft Copilot Studio. This Copilot assistant will **help farmers by providing information across three scenarios** where specific information resides on three different websites:

- Providing specific information on **farming queries** by searching the public website of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and providing contextual answers to farmer queries.
- Based on the query answer on appropriate farming conditions, the farmer can further ask for current **climate conditions** from Weather.com to get a detailed weather report.
- Additionally, we provide information about **loan facilities** by querying the farmers.gov site.

We will leverage Generative Answers and Generative Topic Routing (previously known as Dynamic Chaining) to ensure a seamless and efficient user experience.

## Add Topics

In Microsoft Copilot Studio, topics are the fundamental building blocks that define how a conversation with a copilot progresses. They represent discrete conversation paths that, when combined, allow users to have natural and flowing interactions with the copilot. Here are the key aspects of topics in Copilot Studio:

### Core Components of Topics

- **Trigger Phrases**: These are phrases, keywords, or questions that a user is likely to use, which are related to the topic. When a user's input matches or is close to these trigger phrases, the corresponding topic is activated. For example, a topic about store hours might be triggered by the phrase "check store hours" or similar variations.
- **Conversation Nodes**: These are the action steps within a topic that define what the copilot should do once the topic is triggered. Actions can include asking questions, sending messages, triggering cloud flows, setting variable values, or using conditions for branching logic.

## Conclusion

In this guide, we've walked through the process of creating a powerful Farming Assistant chatbot using Microsoft Copilot Studio. By leveraging Generative Answers and Generative Topic Orchestration, we've enabled the Farming Assistant to provide seamless, contextually accurate information across various farming-related queries. This assistant integrates data from three distinct public websites, ensuring comprehensive support for farmers:

1. USDA for detailed farming information and best practices.
2. Weather.com for real-time weather updates pertinent to farming locations.
3. Farmers.gov for information on available loan options and financial assistance.

By enabling dynamic topic routing and configuring targeted data sources, we've created a robust and intelligent Copilot that can dynamically handle user queries and provide precise answers grounded in reliable information. This Farming Assistant not only simplifies the decision-making process for farmers but also demonstrates the potential of Microsoft Copilot Studio in creating sophisticated AI solutions.

This project highlights the effectiveness of combining generative AI with well-structured topic orchestration, setting a precedent for developing other domain-specific assistants.
