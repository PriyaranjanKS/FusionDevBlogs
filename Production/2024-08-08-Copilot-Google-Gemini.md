## Introduction
In this blog, we will explore how to create a custom connector for the Google Gemini API in Microsoft Power Platform and use it within Copilot to build a dynamic Meal and Fitness Advisor. This process leverages advanced AI capabilities to generate personalized recommendations based on user inputs such as meal preferences and fitness goals.

The user can ask personalized Meal and Fitness plan and the Copilot will use Google Gemini API connector to provide back the contextual plan back to the user

## Process Overview
We will follow these steps to achieve our goal:
1. Obtain the API key from Google AI Studio.
2. Create a custom connector in Power Automate to interact with the Google Gemini API.
3. Develop a Copilot in Copilot Studio that utilizes this custom connector to get the personalize Meal and Fitness Plan.

## Technologies Involved
- **Google Gemini API**: Used for generating personalized content based on user inputs.
- **Microsoft Power Automate**: To create a custom connector that interacts with the Google Gemini API.
- **Copilot Studio**: To create and manage the Copilot bot.
- **Microsoft Teams**: The platform where the Copilot will be deployed and used.

## Prerequisites
1. Access to the Google Gemini API and API keys.
2. Access to Microsoft Power Automate and Copilot Studio.

## Demo 

Lets see the demo of the overall process before we get into the implementation : 

## Step 1: Get the Gemini API Key

## Testing the Connector
1. We can use the in-built test functionality to ensure that your connector works correctly. To do this, click on **Authorize** and paste the Google API Key which we copied from the Google AI Studio into the field and click on **Authorize**.

    ![Authorize](\images\12_CopilotGemini\6.png)

2. Click on **Try it out** and paste the below text in the body. Here we are passing the query to find the capital of the United States in the body.
    ```json
    {
      "contents": [
        {
          "role": "user",
          "parts": [
            {
              "text": "Capital of United States"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    ![Try it out](\images\12_CopilotGemini\7.png)

3. Click on **Execute** to invoke the API and get back the contextual response from Google Gemini.

    ![Execute](\images\12_CopilotGemini\7_1.png)

4. As we go down the editor, we can see that it has successfully fetched back the capital of the United States.

    ![Response](\images\12_CopilotGemini\8.png)

5. Now that we have created the connector using the swagger definition, let's click on **Create Connector**.

    ![Create Connector](\images\12_CopilotGemini\9.png)

6. The Google Gemini Generate Content Connector is now available for use within the Power Platform.

    ![Connector Available](\images\12_CopilotGemini\10.png)

## Step 3: Create Copilot
1. Head over to [Copilot Studio](https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com/) and click on **Create**.

    ![Create Copilot](\images\12_CopilotGemini\1_3.png)

2. This will provide us the option to create a copilot based on an existing template or create a blank copilot from scratch. Let's select **New copilot**.

    ![New Copilot](\images\12_CopilotGemini\1_4.png)

3. This will take us to the page where we can:
   1. Describe the copilot functionality and provide any specific instructions to the copilot.
   2. Once done, click on **Create** to provision the copilot.

    ![Describe Copilot](\images\12_CopilotGemini\11.png)

## Step 4: Enable Generative Selection of Topics
1. The copilot is now created. We can then make the needed configuration changes:
   1. Click on **Edit**, edit the copilot details like name, icon, and description.
   2. Click on **Settings** to enable the Generative selection of topics so that without relying on triggers, the topics will be auto-selected based on user conversation resulting in a much smoother user experience.

    ![Edit Copilot](\images\12_CopilotGemini\12.png)

2. To enable the automatic detection of topics from user interaction:
   1. Click on **Generative AI**.
   2. Select **Generative (preview)**.
   3. Click on **Save** to update the settings.
   4. Click on the **Close** icon to go back to the home page of this custom copilot.

    ![Generative AI](\images\12_CopilotGemini\12_1.png)

## Step 5: Create Topics
1. Now let’s go ahead and create the topics that will automatically redirect the conversation flow to appropriate topics based on the question the user posts.
   1. Click on **Topics** from the navigation menu.

    ![Topics](\images\12_CopilotGemini\13.png)

2. To add the topic, we can either go with the option to create a blank topic or use Copilot to create the topic with an initial set of prepopulated conversation nodes based on the topic description that we provide.
   1. Click on **Add a Topic** and
   2. Select **Create from description with Copilot**.

    ![Add Topic](\images\12_CopilotGemini\14.png)

3. Let’s provide the below topic description details in the pop-up that opened when we clicked the **Add topic** button previously. Then, click on **Create**, which will provision the topic skeleton based on the provided description.

    ![Topic Description](\images\12_CopilotGemini\15.png)

4. Thus, we have the basic topic created with an automatic trigger as well as a few questions to the user which are generated using the description provided.

    ![Topic Created](\images\12_CopilotGemini\16.png)

5. In addition to the meal preference, the questions around fitness goals and morbidities are also generated automatically, and responses are stored in respective variables which we will use down the line to pass to Google Gemini.

## Step 6: Create the Prompt and Assign it to the Variable
1. Let’s create the prompt and assign it to the variable. For this, we will select **Variable management** -> **Set a variable value**.

    ![Variable Management](\images\12_CopilotGemini\17.png)

2. We will create a new variable and name it as **varPrompt**.

    ![New Variable](\images\12_CopilotGemini\18.png)

3. We will be creating a table-structured prompt to send it to the Google Gemini Custom Connector. In the **To value** field, use the below concatenate formula to create a prompt which will contain the meal preference, fitness goals, and morbidities information.
    ```markdown
    Table({role: "user", parts: [{text: Concatenate("Act as a Personalized Meal Advisor and Fitness Coach for a personal with the below morbidities: ", Topic.ExistingMorbidities, "The Meal Preferences are: ", Topic.MealPreference, ". Fitness Goals are: ", Topic.FitnessGoals)}]})
    ```

    The table structure described in the prompt is used to format the input data for the Google Gemini API’s text generation endpoint.
    - **Role**: This specifies who is providing the input. In this context, the role is set to "user," indicating that the input is coming from the user of the system. This helps the AI model understand the perspective or the context from which the content is generated.
    - **Parts**: This is an array containing the actual content to be processed by the AI model. Parts will contain the actual prompt that describes the context and what is expected as a response from the model.

4. Once the formula is added to the box, click on **Insert**.

    ![Insert Formula](\images\12_CopilotGemini\19.png)

## Step 7: Add the Google Gemini Custom Connector as an Action
1. Now that the prompt is ready, let's add the Google Gemini custom connector as an action.

    ![Add Action](\images\12_CopilotGemini\20.png)

2. As we add the connector, it will ask to create a connection. Click on **Create**.

    ![Create Connection](\images\12_CopilotGemini\21.png)

3. Add the connection name and paste the Google API Key copied from Google AI Studio. Click on **Create** and then **Submit**.

    ![Connection Details](\images\12_CopilotGemini\22.png)

4. Let’s configure the Google Gemini custom connector with the needed input values.
    - Specify the API Version as **v1beta**.
    - Mention the model name as **gemini-pro**.
    - For the Contents field, select the **varPrompt** variable that we had created earlier.

    ![Configure Connector](\images\12_CopilotGemini\23.png)

5. We can see that the generative output of the connector is stored in the variable **text**.

    ![Generative Output](\images\12_CopilotGemini\24.png)

6. Now let’s add a basic card and show the text output back to the user.

    ![Basic Card](\images\12_CopilotGemini\25.png)

## Test the Copilot
We have published the bot and will distribute it to Microsoft Teams by submitting it to the admin for approval.

![Submit for Approval](\images\12_CopilotGemini\27.png)

Admins can now publish this to the organization from the Teams admin center.

![Publish to Teams](\images\12_CopilotGemini\28.png)

The Meal and Fitness Coach has now become available in the Teams app store which we can start using.We have provided the basic information and preferences around the meal and fitness plan that we are looking at.

![Publish to Teams](\images\12_CopilotGemini\35.png)

Google Gemini API is invoked through the custom connector, and we can see the detailed meal and fitness plan provided by the copilot.
